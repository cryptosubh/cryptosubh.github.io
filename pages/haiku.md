#Haikus

**09/04/2024**

```
Dusty leaves
On perennial spring grass;
Trampled over
```

**09/03/2024**

```
Dewy dark meadow 
Trod on by sprinter's foot 
Hit by sunrise
```
**08/03/2024**

```
Frozen ripples melt
Gentle leap of fish amidst
Silent blossom springs
```
**27/02/2024**

```
Cry of a cuckoo
Spring waves over grass
Tumbled ink-pot
```
