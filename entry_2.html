Wonderfully written, the article provided a bird's eye view of the larger-than-life mathematician who pioneered in techniques which have become staple and inseperable from modern geometry, if not the entirety of math. While multi-faceted life of Grothendieck draws awe and admiration to various aspects, what immediately struck me was his philosophy towards solving mathematical problems. In his memoir <i>Récoltes et Semailles</i>, Grothendieck relates two
